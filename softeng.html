The common misconception of software engineers is that they are always working in a dark room with a bright screen. Mayuko tells us that this is completely wrong and shows footage of her and her coworkers talking over things in order to get ideas flowing.

<p>
another misconception is that technical skills are more important that the soft skills or personal skills. In order to effectively collaborate, there must be an underlying understadning of soft skills to make the interpersonal communication smooth. having good soft skills helps work move quicker because you are able to convey thoughts to help co workers and help them help you.

Mayuko also placed value on being able to be yourself with your co workers. This takes stress off of your back that would hinder the amount of work being done. Being authentic as a computer software allows you to bring new ways of thinking to the table when collaborating
